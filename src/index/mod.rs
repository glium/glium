/*!
In order to draw, you need to provide a way for the video card to know how to link primitives
together.

There are eleven types of primitives, each one with a corresponding struct:

 - `PointsList`
 - `LinesList`
 - `LinesListAdjacency`
 - `LineStrip`
 - `LineStripAdjacency`
 - `TrianglesList`
 - `TrianglesListAdjacency`
 - `TriangleStrip`
 - `TriangleStripAdjacency`
 - `TriangleFan`
 - `Patches`

There are two ways to specify the indices that must be used:

 - Passing a reference to an `IndexBuffer`, which contains a list of indices.
 - `NoIndices`, in which case the vertices will be used in the order in which they are in the
   vertex buffer.

## Multidraw indirect

In addition to indices, you can also use **multidraw indirect** rendering.

The idea is to put a list of things to render in a buffer, and pass that buffer to OpenGL.
