/*!

This example demonstrates how to manually create a glium context with any backend you want, most
notably without glutin.

There are three concepts in play:

 - The `Backend` trait, which defines how glium interfaces with the OpenGL context
   provider (glutin, SDL, glfw, etc.).

 - The `Context` struct, which is the main object of glium. The context also provides
   OpenGL-related functions like `get_free_video_memory` or `get_supported_glsl_version`.

 - The `Facade` trait, which is the trait required to be implemented on objects that you pass
   to functions like `VertexBuffer::new`. This trait is implemented on `Rc<Context>`, which
   means that you can direct pass the context.
